  /// characters beyond the Basic Latin block (U+0000 to U+007F) of the
  /// Unicode Standard. See RFC 8264. Currently there are four profiles
  /// for internationalized strings: two for strings serving as user
  /// identifiers, one for arbitrary single-line strings (such as
  /// passwords), and one for display names.</para></summary>
  /// <remarks>
  /// <list>
  /// <item>Other user-facing internationalized strings not expressly
  /// handled by this class include the following. Their preparation and
  /// comparison are outside the scope of this class.
  /// <br/> -- File and directory names.
  /// <br/> -- Domain names.
  /// <br/> -- Text strings with multiple language versions (such as a
  /// checkbox's label or a dialog box's title).
  /// <br/> -- Profile data voluntarily entered by users.
  /// <br/> -- The text of article, post, and message bodies.</item>
  /// <item>The methods in this class are not well suited for
  /// <i>collation</i>, or lexicographic ordering, which is a comparison
  /// of text strings that is usually language-dependent and goes beyond
  /// equality comparison. Further discussion on collation can be found
  /// in Unicode Technical Standard 10 (UTS 10), "Unicode Collation
  /// Algorithm".</item>
  /// <item>As explained in UTS 10 sec. 1.6, collation serves the
  /// purposes of searching and selection (for example, searching by name
  /// or by title). However, this class is directed more to equality
  /// comparisons for authentication or authorization purposes, or to
  /// avoid creating multiple items that use the same string, rather
  /// than, say, to comparisons of names or parts of names for the
  /// purpose of showing matching records.</item></list>
  /// <para><b>Security Considerations</b></para>
  /// <para>Many of the methods in this class take text strings and
  /// output text strings. However, specifying text strings as these
  /// methods do is not ideal if the string represents a password or
  /// other sensitive data, since strings are immutable in.NET and Java,
  /// so that they can't be modified, and the memory they occupy is not
  /// guaranteed to be cleared in a timely fashion due to garbage
  /// collection.</para>
  /// <para>The methods in this class are not guaranteed to be
  /// "constant-time" (nondata-dependent) for all relevant inputs.
  /// Neither are string comparison methods (such as String.Equals)
  /// necessarily guaranteed to be "constant-time". Certain attacks that
  /// involve encrypted communications have exploited the timing and
  /// other aspects of such communications to derive keying material or
  /// cleartext indirectly, or for example, to leak information about
  /// whether a user name and password were accepted by the server, or
  /// whether a user name or display name was already taken. This is an
  /// important consideration especially for strings representing account
  /// identifiers or passwords, even when comparing two such strings of
  /// the same length.</para></remarks>
